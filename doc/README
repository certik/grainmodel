Compilation
===========

apt-get install tetex-bin tetex-extra

./make

this will create "grain.ps" and "grain.pdf" in the "tmp" directory.

to clean the sources, use:

./clean


Note:
-----

You can also install texlive instead of tetex, but the 
font generation doesn't work:

apt-get install texlive texlive-formats-extra texlive-generic-recommended
